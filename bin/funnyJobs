They fix societies’ problems? What heroes.

I’m not sure where to begin with this one.

They’re trying a bit too hard to wrap it up in cool-sounding words.

5. Social Media Rockstar

I’m sure they play guitar heroes.

6. Community Wizard

They’re casting spells on people now?

7. Executive Social Media Architect

They design buildings? I thought social media was virtual…

8. Social Media Engager

Surely every social media professional engages with people? Isn’t that what “social” means?

They invented socialism?

10. Community Management Pro

Anyone who gets paid to manage communities is a professional.

11. Superior Social Tactician

That’s a little far-fetched. Are they a general planning battles now?

Being addicted to social media is not big and it’s not clever.

13. Digital Achiever

What does this even mean?

14. Social Visionary

That’s taking it a bit far…

Sounds like a glorified community manager, except how do they direct a whole community?

They fight other social media professionals? En garde!

Do they mean a customer service representative?

Every young, single guy needs a good wing-man.

They operate a whole community? Maybe it’s best they let someone else join in.

Social media has its own symphonies now?

22. Social Performer

Ah, they’re the ones who are directed by the Social Media Composer.

23. Digital Marketing Constructor

How does one build digital marketing? It’s a service, not an object.
 real social media job titles
I’m not making these social media job titles up. People are actually using them!
24. Social Marketing Guru

Now commonly used, mostly for those who definitely are not gurus.

25. Epic Social Manager

Probably won’t be living up to the title if they have to use this to stand out.

26. Social Media Assassin

Who have they killed in the virtual world to earn their stripes?

Oh man. Too much World of Warcraft I think.

29. Digital Demigod

Half man, half… virtual?

30. Social Media Ninja

A covert agent. How do they execute social marketing if they’re stealth and no one see’s them?

Abracadabra and their job disappears.

They’ve been in some tough battles I know. Keep swinging soldier!

33. The Social Media Badass

I’m not sure what to say about this one…

34. Social Media Vixen

I kind of get the play on the female fox, who is supposed to be clever and deceptive, but it really doesn’t work and comes off like they’re flirting their way to connections.

35. Social Sensei

This sounds like they’re old and trying to make it sound cool.

Not a lot of thought was put into this one!

37. Chief People Herder

Do they use a people-prod?

Be careful when mixing social potions – they can be dangerous.

39. Head of Interactions

I’m staggered at how far people are going…

40. Chatter Monkey

Is this even a job title or just a description of their tendency to talk a lot?

41. Community Data Guerrilla

Definitely an irregular or indigenous person, operating behind enemy lines to harass the enemy. It’s perfectly clear.

42. Social Media Swami

I didn’t even know what this meant until Uncle Google told me.

43. Public Happy Maker

Puke.

44. Brand Champion

Who did they compete against to be considered the ‘Champion’?

Does this mean they are constantly monitoring everyone’s conversations?

You can tell they create some really imaginative tweets.

Do they spend their whole day just thinking?

They only initiate, but don’t execute?
